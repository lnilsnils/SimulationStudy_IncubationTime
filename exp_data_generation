    ###Ronald:  the code below generates exponential increase with growth factor 1.14 instead of exp(0.14)=1.15. total_cases should depend on the number on the first day via x_i=exp(0.14*i)*x_0
    #new_cases <- round(total_cases * (exp(growth_rate)-1)) #exp(0.14)-1
    total_cases <- total_cases + round(total_cases * (exp(growth_rate) - 1))
  }
